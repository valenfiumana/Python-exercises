## Python Programming
This repository contains a collection of Python exercises with their corresponding solutions, which I've done for the 4-month UNSAM course on Python Programming. These exercises cover a range of topics and difficulty levels, from basic syntax and data structures to more advanced concepts like object-oriented programming and algorithmic problem solving.

### Getting Started
To get started with these exercises, you will need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official website [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Exercises
The exercises are organized by topic in separate directories. Each exercise has a description and my solution.
1. [Strings, Lists, Math Operations, Loops, Conditionals](./01/01.md)
2. [Functions, Files, csv, dictionaries, tuples](./02/02.md)

### Cheatsheets
I've also created a [directory](./Cheatsheets) with cheatsheets that cover the theory I've learned. 

### Conclusion
These exercises were a great way for me to solidify my understanding of Python programming concepts. I hope you find them helpful in your own learning journey!
